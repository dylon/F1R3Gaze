# F1R3Gaze

A browser whose only execution mechanism is f1r3lang on a native RSpace.
HTML and CSS are rendered by [Blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz);
everything a page *does* is a f1r3lang program run by the CampF1R3 executive
in the tab. No JavaScript is ever executed. Pages hold capabilities, not
ambient authority, and sites published on a F1R3FLY shard are resolved and
verified through the shard bridge.

This repository implements the *F1R3Gaze Implementation Specification* v0.1
(`publications/f1r3gaze`): the portable core, the native browser (P1–P3), the
signed installers of P4, and the reach tier.

## Using it

```
f1r3gaze [URL]                      open a window (default: gaze://newtab)
f1r3gaze --headless URL [--allow] [--click SELECTOR]... [--timeout SECS] [--wait SECS] [--log FILE.gzlog]
                                    run a page without a window; print its committed
                                    document and console (CI smoke tests)
f1r3gaze --profile DIR ...          keep every folder under DIR: DIR/{config,data,state,cache,runtime}
                                    (also: F1R3GAZE_PROFILE)
f1r3gaze wallet new|import|export|use|list|balance|send|remove ...
                                    the wallets that pay for deploys (docs/wallet.md)
f1r3gaze paths                      print where the folders are
f1r3gaze profile check|backups ...  what a start would change; start-up's backups
f1r3gaze trust list|forget ...      this shard's freshness records

f1r3c compile app.rho [-o app.knf] [--level k1g] [--import IDENT=URN]...
f1r3c inspect app.knf               manifest, hashes, program text
f1r3c integrity app.knf             value for the HTML integrity attribute
f1r3c site DIR [--entry index.html] [--mirror URL]... [--out OUT]
                                    package a site: blobs by hash + the registry manifest
```

A page loads its behaviour like this, and the browser refuses it if the
bytes do not match:

```html
<script type="application/f1r3lang" src="app.knf" integrity="blake2b-256:420d…"></script>
```

or inline, naming the capabilities it imports:

```html
<script type="application/f1r3lang" imports="doc">
  new found, sub, clicks in {
    doc!("query1", "#lamp", *found) |
    for (@("ok", *lamp) <- found) { lamp!("listen", "click", *clicks, {}, *sub) | … }
  }
</script>
```

Addresses: `https://…` and `http://…` (plain HTTP can be switched off),
`f1r3://<publisher>/<project>@<range>/<path>` for shard sites,
`f1r3h://blake2b-256/<hex>` for content by hash, `file://…`, and the
built-in `gaze://newtab` and `gaze://about`.

Settings live in `settings.toml` in the settings folder (`f1r3gaze paths`
prints it): one table per area, `[appearance]`, `[browsing]`, `[shard]`,
`[wallet]`, `[content]` and `[site_data]`. Where each kind of file is kept
on Linux, macOS and Windows, and how an older single-folder profile is
moved on the first start: `f1r3-work/f1r3gaze/README.md`, sections "Where
F1R3Gaze keeps its files" and "Upgrading from a single-folder profile".

### The wallet: the agent driving the browser pays

Every deploy the browser makes (a page's program, a session message) is
signed by the **active wallet**, whose account pays for it. Wallets are
created, imported and exported in the same file format as **F1R3Sky**, and
their addresses are the F1R3Cap addresses F1R3Sky shows. Keys live in the OS
keychain (macOS, Windows) or a `0600` file per key in the data folder's
`wallet/keys/` (Linux).

A program deployed under the user's key could otherwise take the deployer's
identity and spend from the wallet, so the browser renders every deploy
itself and binds only allow-listed system names: registry, standard output,
the deploy id, block data, crypto. **`rho:rchain:deployerId` is refused.** A
page can cost phlo (the consent prompt quotes it, with the paying wallet and
its balance); it cannot move funds. Transfers go through Embers, as in
F1R3Sky, but the browser decodes and checks every prepared contract against
Embers' transfer template before signing it. Details: `docs/wallet.md`.

### Events

A listener receives `(type, fields)`. `docs/events.md` lists the fields
guaranteed for each event type; hosts may add more, so pages end their
patterns with a remainder: `@(_, {"x": x, "y": y ..._})`.

## Building

```
cd f1r3-work/f1r3gaze
cargo build --release -p gaze-shell -p f1r3c     # target/release/{f1r3gaze,f1r3c}
cargo test --workspace
cargo build -p gaze-reach --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --profile reach
```

Rust 1.91, edition 2024. CampF1R3 (`gaze/map-remainders`, rev `ea2d323`) and
Blitz (rev `674d7d2`) are git dependencies pinned by revision; the CampF1R3
revision must be pushed to GitHub before a clean checkout can build. On Linux the
window needs Vulkan (or Mesa's `lavapipe`, `mesa-vulkan-drivers`) and
`libxkbcommon`; macOS and Windows need nothing extra. Building the windowed
binary in debug mode wants about 4 GB of memory to link.

## Releases (P4)

Pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds and
publishes a draft GitHub release with:

| platform | artifacts | signing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `F1R3Gaze-<v>-macos-universal.dmg` and component `.pkg` (arm64 + x86_64) | Developer ID, hardened runtime with **no** exceptions (no JIT entitlement: there is no JavaScript), notarised and stapled when credentials are configured |
| Windows | `F1R3Gaze-<v>-x64.msi`, portable `.zip` | Authenticode (`signtool`, SHA-256, RFC 3161 timestamp) on both executables and the MSI |
| Linux x86_64 and arm64 | `.deb`, Arch `.pkg.tar.zst`, distro-specific `.rpm`, `.AppImage`, `.tar.gz` | GPG-signed `SHA256SUMS` covering every artifact of every platform when a key is configured |

Secrets: `MACOS_CERT_P12`, `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`, `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY`,
`MACOS_INSTALLER_CERT_P12`, `MACOS_INSTALLER_CERT_PASSWORD`,
`MACOS_INSTALLER_SIGN_IDENTITY`,
`APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`; `WINDOWS_CERT_PFX`,
`WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD`; `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GPG_PASSPHRASE`, and the
`GPG_EXPECTED_FINGERPRINT` repository variable. A production tag requires all
signing and notarization inputs before creating a draft release. Fork CI runs
build unsigned artifacts for installation smoke tests. The Windows
installer and the Linux packages register `f1r3://` and `f1r3h://`. Scripts:
`packaging/{linux,macos,windows}/`, icons from the F1R3FLY.io brand kit in
`packaging/icons/`.

Verify a download: `gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.
See [the distribution build guide](docs/distribution.md) for local builds,
repository staging, Homebrew and WinGet manifests, and the current limits of
native installer validation. Gaze packages include `f1r3c` and its in-process
RSpace; F1R3Node remains a separate optional service and Embers is excluded.

## Reach tier

`crates/gaze-reach` compiles the executive and the DOM protocol to one wasm
module (no `wasm-bindgen`); `web/gaze-reach.js` is its host in any modern
browser: the DOM backend over the real page, the frame loop, `net` (same
origin, integrity checked inside the module), `store` (IndexedDB) and `nav`.
`shard` is a dead channel there, since a stock browser has no key custody a
page cannot reach. `.github/workflows/reach.yml` publishes the module and the
demo page to GitHub Pages. A page opts in with

```html
<script type="module" src="gaze-reach.js"></script>
```

## Upstream changes to CampF1R3 (in `patches/`)

- **U1 ground data.** Booleans, 64-bit integers, strings, bytes, lists, tuples
  and maps through lexer, parser (level `K1G`), AST, normaliser, encoding
  (tags `0x09`–`0x0F`), decoding, substitution, JSON, printer and matcher.
  Maps are ordered by key encoding; duplicate literal keys are rejected.
- **U3** `Machine::with_observer`, and `Observer::observe_aperture`.
- **U4** `bind_aperture`, `take_outbound`, `inject`.
- **U6** the `Keyed` minter.
- A job whose cut an observer refuses is put back at the head of the queue,
  so an exhausted budget stops progress without losing work.
- **Remainder patterns** for lists and maps (branch `gaze/map-remainders`,
  commit `ea2d323`, offered as input to the map-pattern design):
  `[a, b ...rest]`, `{"k": v ...rest}`. A map pattern matches by key lookup;
  keys must be ground. See the commit message for the full design.

Three defects in the existing code were found and fixed on the way:

1. Substitution reversed the arguments of a polyadic send (`rebuild.rs`).
2. The matcher bound a name pattern to the raw quote `@P` instead of applying
   `@*x = x`, so a received name could not be sent on. The rewrite was missing
   at three sites: the `*y` process pattern, the datum-to-name goal, and
   `Chan::quote`.
3. A quoted pattern `@{*y}` could not match a concrete (unforgeable) name.


## Tests

67 tests in this workspace, all passing (CampF1R3 carries its own 181):

| crate | tests | what they establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gaze-exec` | 9 | the specification's lamp; replay with identical commit hashes; seeds; dead channels; confinement; timers; bounded runaway pages; a remainder listener survives extra event fields where an exact one goes silent |
| `gaze-dom-core`, `gaze-graded`, `gaze-knf` | 16 | the protocol engine, the semirings, the container |
| `gaze-dom-blitz` | 7 | Blitz and `MemDom` commit identical hashes frame by frame; a Blitz log replays identically on both, including a click on a never-named node; scoped queries cannot leak; `decide` prevents; `setHTML` |
| `gaze-broker` | 5 | policy, prompts, remembered grants, routes, revocation |
| `gaze-net`, `gaze-store`, `gaze-blob` | 10 | redirects, credentials stripped, hashes; torn-tail recovery and quota; verified cache |
| `gaze-shard` | 11 | the deploy preimage matches `prost`; signatures verify; against mock nodes: a lying observer is outvoted, a split is an error, a rollback is stale, nothing is deployed before consent, and the body the validator receives verifies |
| `gaze-wallet` | 5 | addresses, wallet files and signature bytes identical to the Embers SDK's own output; the contract check refuses a changed recipient, amount or note, smuggled code, hidden fields, a high fee or another shard; wallets kept, exported, switched; transfers through an honest mock Embers, and nothing signed for a dishonest one |
| `gaze-reach` | 3 | the reach tier commits exactly the native executive's hashes for the same page and clicks; integrity; `shard` is dead |
| `gaze-shell` | 1 | settings |

End-to-end, on the real binary:

- the new-tab page's f1r3lang lamp toggles on a click;
- a site's `.knf` is fetched by `src`, integrity-checked, fetches over `net`,
  writes and reads `store`, logs, and saves a replay log; a tampered copy is
  refused with "integrity mismatch";
- in the window (Linux, Xvfb, Vello on lavapipe): tabs, the address bar with
  typed navigation, the console and grants panels, and a real click handled
  by the page — screenshots in `f1r3-work/f1r3gaze/docs/screenshots/`;
- the wallet, through the whole stack against a mock node: a page's deploy is
  quoted naming the paying wallet, signed by it, and finalized; a program
  asking for `rho:rchain:deployerId` is refused before anything reaches the
  node; a wallet file in F1R3Sky's format imports and exports byte for byte;
- in the window: the wallet panel lists wallets with balances from Embers,
  switches the paying wallet, and sends a transfer after a confirming click
  (screenshots 06–08);
- the `.deb` installs and runs, the AppImage runs, and the signed checksums
  verify (and fail on a changed byte).

## Deviations from the specification, for review


- **Ground values** are two node variants, `Lit` and `Coll` (a map's items
  alternate key and value), not one `Ground(Lit)`.
- **Authority of names.** A name obtained through another name inherits its
  root, so a page can navigate its own document (`parent`, `closest`). A new
  verb, `attenuate`, mints a name rooted at its own node; that is the name a page
  hands to a component to confine it. The specification's literal rule (every
  name rooted at itself) would make `parent` useless.
- **Commit hash.** The hash recorded per frame is of the committed document's
  serialisation, not of the write batch.
- **One executive per window thread.** Each tab's executive runs on the
  window thread, paced to 16 ms in the foreground and 250 ms in the background,
  rather than on a worker per tab.
- **The chrome is Rust-driven HTML.** Making it a f1r3lang page with a
  privileged capability is K1 (P4) work.
- **The bridge speaks the node's HTTP API** (`/api/deploy`, `/api/registry`,
  `/api/explore-deploy`, `/ws/events`) rather than Embers' gRPC
  `firefly-client`, which needs `protoc` and `tonic` at build time. Deploys are
  byte-for-byte what the node verifies.
- **Linux keys** are in a `0600` file in the data folder's `wallet/keys/`; macOS and Windows use
  the OS keychain (`os-keyring`, on in release builds).
- **One wallet signs for every site** (the spec's per-site keys are gone:
  the account that pays is the deployer). Sites can therefore link a user's
  deploys; users who want separate identities keep several wallets. Session
  keys remain as session identities but no longer sign.

## Not in this release

- U2 guards and U5 (the resolver seam): K2 and graded pages are refused at
  load, naming the work package.
- The `proof` rung (node work package N1) and the `replayed` rung: they answer
  `("err", "unavailable", …)`.
- `rho:serve` resolution depends on the VersionedRegistry step 6 on the node.
- Legacy JavaScript tabs, devtools time travel, the gateway.
- Opening `f1r3://` links from other macOS apps (Apple-event URL handling).
- Authenticating session messages to their service (a signed-message
  scheme verified on chain); today a session is identified, not proven.
- A `pay` capability for pages (a payment request the user approves in the
  wallet); pages cannot initiate transfers.
